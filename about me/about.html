              Hi there! I am Zon Trisha M. Japay, a passionate and dedicated Information Technology student currently
              pursuing my studies at University of the Immaculate Conception. Throughout this academic journey, I have
              had the privilege of delving into the dynamic, ever-evolving and embarked on a journey to explore and
              conquer the fascinating realm of technology. This portfolio serves as a showcase of my learning, projects,
              and experiences in the field of IT.<br /><br />As a budding IT enthusiast, I am constantly seeking
              opportunities to expand my knowledge and apply it to real-world scenarios. My passion for this course was
              ignited at an early age when I discovered the transformative power of computers and their ability to solve
              complex problems. This passion has since grown into a relentless pursuit of knowledge and a commitment to
              leveraging technology to make a positive impact.
